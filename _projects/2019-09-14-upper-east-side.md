Brows are tinted at the beginning of the service to darken the baby blonde hairs that hide inside and around the brow, thus giving Lauren a fuller shape to work with. This is followed by thoughtful trimming and an expertly restrained approach to shaping with a tweezer. The final step is a one on one tutorial on your ideal brow shape for your face and how to maintain the look at home. |
